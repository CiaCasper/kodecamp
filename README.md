ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe Rule-Based AI

A simple rule-based Python function that plays Tic-Tac-Toe intelligently without using search algorithms.
The AI follows basic strategic rules: win if possible, block if needed, take the center, then corners, then sides.

ðŸ§  Logic Flow

Determine whose turn it is (x starts first).

Check if the current player can win in one move.

If not, check if it can block the opponentâ€™s winning move.

If not, take the center.

If not, take a corner.

Otherwise, take a side.
